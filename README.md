# Greyhound

A point cloud querying and streaming framework over HTTP for the web and your native apps.

# Tell me more
_Greyhound_ is powered by [Entwine](https://entwine.io/) which is used to organize
data in a form that Greyhound can then emit to clients. Entwine uses [PDAL](http://pdal.io)
for data access and abstraction to a wide variety of formats.  See the [client
documentation](https://github.com/hobu/greyhound/blob/master/doc/clientDevelopment.rst)
and the [administrator
documentation](https://github.com/hobu/greyhound/blob/master/doc/administration.rst)
for more details on development and deployment.

A simple
[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) HTTP
protocol is used to query and stream points in a format specified by the
client.
